# ü§ñ Discord Docker Bot

Build and deploy a Discord bot onto your server to collaboratively manage Docker containers with your Discord server.
## üìö Guide

1. **Node Installation**: You need Node.js installed to run this bot on your server.

2. **Discord Bot Setup**: Make sure you have a Discord bot and have the token saved.
    - If you don't already have a Discord bot, create one at [Discord Developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
    - Go into OAuth2 - URL Generator and enable the bot checkbox in the scopes and invite the bot to your server.

3. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository into your server directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-docker-bot.git
    cd discord-docker-bot
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. **Create .env File**: Create a `.env` file to store your Discord token with this key.
    ```plaintext
    DISCORD_TOKEN=[your discord bot token]
    ```

6. **Start the Bot**: Run npm run start to start the bot.
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

7. **Bot Online**: Now the bot should be online in your Discord server. The repo comes with default commands `!start` and `!close` to start and shut down your Docker container.
